      <h4><strong>☐ Add City State To Companies from Zip Code.</strong></h4>
      <p>For each company "Show" page there is a placeholder for the <strong>City, State</strong> for that company. You'll need to leverage the zip code to have that value render the actual <strong>City, State</strong>. For example: <strong> Nashville, TN</strong> There is a failing test in the test suite. It is strongly recomended to use the <a href="https://github.com/monterail/zip-codes">ZipCodes gem</a> that is already in this project.
